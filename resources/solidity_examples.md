# Solidity Examples and Resources

* This link is pure code, however well written. Get understanding of new concepts as balances and transfering of ether, through a bank examples. Also good for understanding build in functions, units etc https://gist.github.com/bellaj/f04f1c2dc5e24dd753a22338519555ad
* Bit related to the above, we have http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/units-and-global-variables.html. However the above is preferable, but could be used together.
